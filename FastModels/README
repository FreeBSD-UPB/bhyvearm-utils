The script expects FastModels and FixedVirtualPlatforms to be installed in
the current directory under the default names (currently, 'ARM' for FastModels
and 'FVP_VE_Cortex-A15x124' for FixedVirtualPlatforms). If not, please update
the FVPDIR and FASTMODELSDIR variables in the script.

Simply running the 'run' script should fetch the host kernel and start the
emulator for you.

Please add the 'licence.dat' file received for the FastModels emulator under
the 'files' directory
